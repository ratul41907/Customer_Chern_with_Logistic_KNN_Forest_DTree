# Customer Churn Prediction Using Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest & Decision Tree

Welcome to the **Customer Churn Prediction** project! This repository demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will churn based on their behavior and attributes. The project includes various models such as **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Random Forest**, and **Decision Tree**, and compares their performances.

## 🚀 Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is essential in customer retention strategies for industries like telecom. This project uses historical customer data to predict the likelihood of churn based on features like demographics, usage patterns, and service information. By leveraging machine learning techniques, businesses can identify high-risk customers and take proactive measures to improve retention.

The notebook implements:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding, and scaling data to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Training different machine learning models and comparing their accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.
- **Visualization**: Displaying important performance metrics and visualizations to interpret model results.

## 🛠 Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
- **Multiple Machine Learning Models**: 
  - **Logistic Regression**: Linear model for binary classification.
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Non-parametric model for classification based on proximity.
  - **Random Forest**: Ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
  - **Decision Tree**: Simple and interpretable model for classification tasks.
- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluate and compare the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## 📊 Models Overview
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method that models the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor variables.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric algorithm that classifies a sample based on the majority label of its nearest neighbors in the feature space.
- **Random Forest**: A supervised learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.
- **Decision Tree**: A tree-like model that makes decisions based on feature values, ideal for visualizing decision-making processes.
